The way that I can make sure that my code, program, and software is functional and secure is by creating test then checking the coverage percentage of each class. This will make sure that everything is working how it should be. Another way that I can make sure it is functional is by manually reviewing my code and eliminating any bias. They way that interpret the user needs are by breaking them down one step at a time then combine the small steps to make sure that it is exactly what the user wanted. The way that I approach software design is the same way, I like to look at the project then break it down into smaller pieces then combine those pieces to create the whole project.
